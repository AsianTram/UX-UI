- Color Harmony (color theory):
  - Monochromatic: use one color in the color wheel with different saturation and brightness
  - Analogous: use colors that are next to each other
  - Complimentary: use colors that are opposite to each other in the wheel
  - Split Complimentary: use the colors that are on either side of it Complimentary one (the ones next to the oposite one)
  - Triadic: use three colors that are evenly spaced

- Guidelines for choosing UI color palette:
  - Harmony: colors should work well together using the principles of color theory
  - Scaleable and Addictive: should have multiple shades of gray and low saturated colors. Could have a systematic pattern which can be added to as the needs of the design system grows
  - Tint your colors with your brands: Tint your grays and black with a hint of your brand color
  - Accessible: must have 4,5:1 color constrast ratio

- How to create a palette from 1 main color:
  - Choose your base color
  - Choose swatches near your base color: these colors will support hover, active and focus states for the base color
  - Choose your darkest color and greys: these swatches are most often used as accents, background colors.
