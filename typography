- Font size:
  - We can use the golden ratio (1.62) to create our font system
  - However, in reality, we normally use the system 8,12,16,24,32,48,64,128
  - Size below 14 is not good
=> That is why we try to adjust the number generated by golden ratio to the standard version or rounded it to an appropriate number

- Type system may include:
  - Headline 1
  - Headline 2
  - Headline 3
  - Subtitle
  - Em
  - Strong
  - Body copy
  - Small copy
  - Button text
  - Pre title

- Readability:
  - Letter spacing: Lager type needs less spacing, while smaller type need more.
  - Spacing: should be between 120%-145% of pt size
  - Line length:
    - usually between 40 to 60 characters
    - wider line lengths, such as desktop, longer lines that contain up to 120 characters will need an increased line height from 20sp to 24sp.
    - for short line length: 20-40 characters per line.
    - Line length: space between the baseline of two blocks of text
      - Should be 1.4 * fontsize
